		<td> {@code java.nio.channels.DefaultThreadPool.threadFactory}</td>
		<td> The value of this property is taken to be the fully-qualified name
			of a concrete {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory ThreadFactory}
			class. The class is loaded using the system class loader and instantiated.
			The factory's {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory#newThread
			newThread} method is invoked to create each thread for the default
			group's thread pool. If the process to load and instantiate the value
			of the property fails then an unspecified error is thrown during the
			construction of the default group.
		</td>

	<tr>
		<td> {@code java.nio.channels.DefaultThreadPool.initialSize}</td>
		<td> The value of the {@code initialSize} parameter for the default
			group (see {@link #withCachedThreadPool withCachedThreadPool}).
			The value of the property is taken to be the {@code String}
			representation of an {@code Integer} that is the initial size parameter.
			If the value cannot be parsed as an {@code Integer} it causes an
			unspecified error to be thrown during the construction of the default
			group.

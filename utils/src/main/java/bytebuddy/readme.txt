Byte Buddy is a code generation and manipulation library for creating and modifying
Java classes during the runtime of a Java application and without the help of a compiler.
Other than the code generation utilities that ship with the Java Class Library(java proxy),
Byte Buddy allows the creation of arbitrary classes and is not limited to implementing interfaces for the creation of runtime proxies.
Furthermore, Byte Buddy offers a convenient API for changing classes either manually, using a Java agent or during a build.

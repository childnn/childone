    // If a throws-advice method throws an exception itself, it overrides the original exception
    // (that is, it changes the exception thrown to the user). The overriding exception is typically a RuntimeException,
    // which is compatible with any method signature. However, if a throws-advice method throws a checked exception,
    // it must match the declared exceptions of the target method and is, hence, to some degree coupled to specific target method signatures.
    // Do not throw an undeclared checked exception that is incompatible with the target methodâ€™s signature!
